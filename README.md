## Acknowledgments

This library was initially written as part of an effort to standardize [ERIS](https://eris.codeberg.page/) over [CoAP](https://eris.codeberg.page/eer/coap.xml). As such this library was indirectly funded by [NGI Assure](https://nlnet.nl/assure), a fund established by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) with financial support from the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu/) program.
